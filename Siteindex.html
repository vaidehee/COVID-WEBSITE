                <h4>History</h4>
                <section>
                  <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
                    The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                 <p>During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus",with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,
                    Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus.In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.
                  <br>Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.</p>
                </section>
                <h4>Causes</h4>
                <section>
                  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                  Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
                  The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
                  The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it‚Äôs important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

                <section><br>
                    <h1 style="text-align: center;"id="symp">SYMPTOMS</h1>
                    <section>
                      <p><br>
                        Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Common symptoms include headache, loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties. People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, 
                        shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19.
                        Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get 
                        tested and can spread the disease.Other infected people will develop symptoms later, called "pre-symptomatic", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.
                        As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days.Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.
                        Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However, some people ‚Äì over half of a cohort of home-isolated young patients ‚Äì continue to experience a range of effects, such as fatigue, for months after recovery, a condition called long COVID; long-term damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.

                      There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[198][needs update] One year into the pandemic, highly effective vaccines have now been introduced and are beginning to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remain important. Thus, the lack of progress developing effective treatments means that the cornerstone of management of COVID-19 has been supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs
                      Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing. Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Are treatments available for COVID-19?</h3>
                    <section>
                      COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that can cause life threatening symptoms. There is currently no cure, but some treatments are available to help manage it.In this article, we discuss the treatment strategies available for COVID-19, at home and in the hospital.

                      We also look at what to do if someone has symptoms, current vaccine options, and how to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease.

                    <h4><u>Drugs</u></h4> 
                  
                    <h6>Veklury (remdesivir)</h6>
                    <p>Veklury (remdesivir) is an antiviral drug that may slow the replication of the virus in the body.

                      According to the FDATrusted Source, studies have shown that using Veklury could speed up the recovery time from COVID-19. The median recovery time was 10 days for people taking Veklury compared with 15 days for those in the placebo group.</p>

                  </section>
                  <h6>Dexamethasone</h6>
                  <p>Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, may help manage symptoms in people with COVID-19 by reducing inflammation. They also may reduce the risk of death in some people with severe symptoms.

                    A doctor may prescribe both steroids and antivirals in some cases.
                    
                    As scientists continue to research the disease and potential treatments, more drugs may receive government approvalTrusted Source. First, however, clinical trials must show that they are safe and effective.</p>
                    <h6>Hydroxycholoquine is not a safe option </h6>
                    <p>Early in the pandemic, the FDA gave approval to use the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as an emergency treatment for COVID-19 symptoms.

                      They later warnedTrusted Source of a risk of ‚Äúserious and potentially life threatening heart rhythm problems‚Äù when using these drugs, and withdrewTrusted Source the approval in June.</p>
                      <h4><u>Care at home</u></h4>
                      <pn>About 80%Trusted Source of people who develop COVID-19 symptoms do not require hospital treatment.</p>
                      <dl>
                        <dt>The following strategies may help manage mild to moderate symptoms at home:</dt>
                        <dd>-Getting plenty of rest.</dd>
                        <dd>-Drinking water regularly to stay hydrated.</dd>
                        <dd>-Taking an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) for body aches, headaches, and fever.</dd>
                        <dd>-Drinking warm liquids, such as tea or soup, to relieve a sore throat.</dd>

                        <p>If a person believes they may have COVID-19, they should take the followingTrusted Source steps to try to avoid passing the virus on to others:</p>
                        <dd>-Staying home other than to seek medical help.
                          Keeping in touch with a healthcare provider.</dd>
